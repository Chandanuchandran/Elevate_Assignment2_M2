        <p><h3><i>Kids nowadays are lucky to have a bevy of streaming services and channels chock-full of cartoons
            to watch at any given moment. It wasn’t always this way. In the ’90s, you had to make sure to check
            the listings to find out when exactly your favorite cartoons would air on television. Sure, there might
            be some funny kids movies or plain ol’ good movies on, but cartoons weren’t on 24/7. Sometimes they were part
            of the Disney Afternoon lineup. Saturday mornings were also a great time for watching ’90s cartoons. And channels 
            like Disney and Nickelodeon also offered plenty of toons to watch. (A lot of the best ’80s cartoons
            have stayed lovable too.) With so many ’90s cartoons to look back on, though, which ones have stood the test of time?

            Luckily, we’re living at a time where you can easily revisit all your old favorites and funny movies with the push of 
            a button. But don’t look to this list for the best animated movies, or even the best ’90s movies—here, you’ll only find 
            the best ’90s cartoons to watch whenever you’re feeling nostalgic for those pre-streaming, dial-up internet, VHS-playing
            days of yore.</i></h3></p>

        <h2>DRAGON TALES</h2>
            <p>Dragon Tales is based on characters created in 1978[6] by Laguna Beach, California artist and retired educator Ron Rodecker. 
                Rodecker was recovering from a coronary artery bypass graft when he began sketching dragons 
                as a means of symbolizing forces in life that were too big to control.</p><br>

            <h2>NODDY</h2>
            <P>Noddy is kind and honest, but he often gets into trouble, either through his own misunderstandings or because someone, 
                usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo, has played a trick on him.
                He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result.</P>
